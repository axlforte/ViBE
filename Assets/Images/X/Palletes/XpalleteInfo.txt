long story short this uses a pallete system so that I can map new colors to preexisting colors
it works by finding the color(s) with a specific r value in its rgb and if it matches with a non-invisible
color in a pallete texture it replaces the color with the corresponding color in the pallete

this is why the pallete textuures are 256 wide instead of a convenient 16; i need to access the whole 256
range of the red channel, ive also changed some colors because they have the same red value. thankfully,
this system is very robust and also allows for use on literally any kind of sprite, you just need a unique
material for all existing entities.

i work so slow on this mojang could actually add a mob in the time i finish
