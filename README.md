# ViBE
The Variable intricate Blast Engine, shortened to ViBE, is an engine that allows users to easily create SNES Megaman X levels.

Editing of the engine is highly encouraged, because i got burnt out and wish to take a break. If your edits are good enough, i will be happy to push to the main branch and give everyone access to your changes!

Doccumentation is provided within the notes folder of the project. it is contained within a unity project that has not been zipped.
